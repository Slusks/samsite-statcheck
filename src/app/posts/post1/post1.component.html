    <h1 style="text-align:center">Solo Part 1: Top Lane Savant, Or Most Improved</h1>
<p>
    I distinctly remember seeing Solo play on Clutch in 2018 and thinking to myself “this player is not very good”. It maybe wasn’t a fair assessment, 
    as his competition was about as stacked as NA top lane gets. NA had been on a Top-lane importing spree and contained such Korean superstars as Impact 
    (Season 3 world champion), Flame (of Flame-Horizon fame), and Huni (fresh off a world championship finals appearance). Likewise it was easy to compare 
    him to NA native Hauntzer and rising rookie Licorice and think that maybe this guy wasn’t on an LCS level.
    <br><br>

    At the start of 2020, Solo wasn’t even on a team, and while people thought this was odd, it wasn’t a decision that earned anything like the vitriol generated by the teamlessness of native NA midlane players Damonte and Pobelter. It wasn’t until the tail end of the 2020 season that Solo was back in a lineup, and he absolutely shocked the world (ok, possibly just me) by being an absolutely monstrous player for his team. I really didn’t remember him being particularly good, but here he was, dragging his team kicking and screaming into the NA LCS finals.
    <br><br>

    So this begs the question, was Solo always a good player? Or has he been held down by the low tier teams he’s been on? He played as a sub in 2016, a starter in 2018 and 2019, and then in the minor (Academy) league for most of the 2020 spring season. Until 2020’s back to back playoff runs, his main claim to fame had been… that he didn’t take an import spot.<br><br>

    Before I continue, I’d like to thank Tim Sevenhuysen and <a href="https://oracleselixir.com/" target="_blank">https://oracleselixir.com/</a> for making this data publicly available. I am not affiliated with Tim or Oracle’s Elixer in any way shape or form.<br><br>

    I decided to check out the numbers and see what they said about this player over the years. First by defining what stats I’m looking at, and why.<br><br>

    <b>Kill/Assists/Deaths, the KDA ratio</b> – These are the simplest low hanging fruit in the League stats world. A player who is getting a significant number of kills is a player that is usually making plays and most actively working to actually win his team the game. Assists shows a similar story, especially for more supporting type champions who’s job isn’t to get kills, but to start fights, secure objectives, and lock down opposing carries. Of course, a player who is dying a lot more is doing nothing but contributing to their opponent’s coffers. Worst of all is the dreaded ‘solo death’, where a player is just outplayed by their opponent.<br><br>

    <b>Gold Share and Damage Share</b> – League of legends is at it’s a core a game of resources. Gold is power, and there is only so much gold available on the map. Teams will often allow players to farm a majority of the waves in late game, or will try and funnel them kills, in the hopes that this player will be able to use that increase in resources to carry the game. Damage share is, in my opinion, a good measure of whether the player is actually doing that carrying. If a player is consistently given 50% of their team’s gold, but only doing 10% of their team’s damage, they are not contributing proportionately to the resources they are being allocated. The caveat here is that top laners are often consigned to a “tank” role. In those instances, their job is to apply crowd control (cc) effects that limit or prevent their opponent’s ability to move or react. This CC is just as vital to any teamfight as the damage brought by other champions, but it is not going to be reflected in high damage numbers.<br><br>

    <b>CS/XP/Gold at 10 and 15</b>– These are early game laning statistics. Generally a top laner in the first 10 minutes isn’t going to do much outside of play in their lane, leading to the common wisdom that “Top lane is an island”. This is likely some of the purest example of skill expression in the game, as the gameplay is basically distilled down to two players pitted against one another. While the champion selection has some influence on this matchup (more on that later), in general a player who is down in CS, XP, and Gold at 10 minutes is losing to their opponent. Occasionally the jungler or mid laner (or both) will roam up to the top lane to try and get their teammate an advantage, and this is why the first blood statistics are being used. The statistics are then checked again at 15 to give an idea on if the player is able to close the gap or push an advantage.<br><br>

    <b>Patch and Result stratification</b><br>
    How a team plays the game has a lot of factors. There might be a player on the opposing team they are looking to “shut down”, there might be a specific champion combination that allows them to be more/or less aggressive. But often, the way the team plays is dictated by the metagame, which defines the generally available strategies and champions. While a team can choose to play “off meta” and go for some off the wall picks or strategies, it’s just not that common, especially in NA. Unfortunately, it’s hard to take the “meta” into account when looking at statistics, so we’re going to use patch’s to help cover the ‘meta’ factor. Every 2 weeks or so, Riot games releases a new patch, which has the potential to greatly affect the meta. These patches can include champion buffs or nerfs, item buffs or nerfs, and occasionally how xp and gold is collected or achieved around the map.
    <br><br>

    The week’s patch does a lot to help define the meta, and so the previously mentioned statistics are all going to be compared on a per-patch basis. This should help to normalize the data as it correlates to the meta, and serves as a nice way to create a timeline for the players.
    <br><br>

    The other way our statistics are going to be grouped is by result. There’s a saying in league that it’s easy for a player to look good on a winning team. Winning teams tend to earn more gold and experience as they snowball a game to victory. It’s rare, for example, that a team wins a game at a gold deficit, or with fewer kills than the opposing team. Some of the best players in the world, however, are known for their gameplay prowess, even on bad or losing teams. So it makes sense to compare player performance both in their wins and losses. Is a player just riding the coattails of their teammates? Or are they the ones making plays and propelling their team to victory?
    <br><br>

    <b>KDA - The Ultimate Statistic</b>
    <br>
    This first visualization is Solo’s combined KDA when compared to the average top laner in the LCS. The dotted line through the middle of each chart is his average across each year. The expectation is that the average values would be higher in his wins than his losses.

    Across all of his games Solo has improved to having an above average KDA when compared to his contemporaries. When you break it down to wins and losses though, you notice that he generally just goes the way of his team. If his teams doing well, Solo is doing well, but if he’s team’s doing poorly, Solo is doing really poorly. Compare that table with the records of his various teams in each of those time periods in games that he played.

        <b>Solo’s stats directly correlate with his team’s success. So overall I think the use of KDA as a measure for him is inconclusive. Solo doesn’t look like he’s been a good player on a bad team, but it also doesn’t appear that he’s been a bad player on a good team.</b> One thing to note is that he’s only been the fulltime starter on a roster in 2018 and Summer 2020, so throughout his career his coaches have not had any issue subbing him out. Still, it’s hard to ignore his 2020 Spring playoff record, where he appeared to level up Flyquests game and get them to a 2nd place finish.
        <br><br>
        With the KDA being inconclusive, the next place to look is in resources. What resources is Solo being allocated, and what is he doing with them?
        <br><br>
        <b>Team Contributions – Damage Share and Gold Share</b>
        <br><br>
        I charted Solo’s average damage share when compared to the composite LCS top average and it looks like he’s pretty on the money.
    </p>
    <div id="AvgDmgShareDashboard"></div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        Looking first at the Average top laner damage share, we can see that it’s fairly tight data. This is telling us that the average damage share of a top laner on a year by year basis is pretty reliably consistent (the data is tightly grouped), and up until 2020, Solo tended to actually be above average in damage share, albeit on terrible teams. It’s interesting that Solo’s damage share seems inversely related to how well his team does. That is, the better his team is performing over that year, the lower his damage share is. <b>This is leading me to believe that Solo excels on supportive or tanky top laners, and is not necessarily played around as a carry threat.</b> This will be something to keep in mind when looking at the champions he plays.
        <br>
        <br>
        The next thing to look at in order to further contextualize Solo’s damage numbers, is his share of resources, specifically earned gold. If he’s being given more resources than your average top laner, one would expect his KDA or damage numbers to be higher. If he’s working as a “low economy” player, then we would expect that to correlate with lower damage performances.
        <br>
        <br>
    </p>
    <div id="AvgGoldShareDashboard"></div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        From the data it would appear that <b>Solo is allocated the same amount of gold as any other top laner</b>, with his earned gold share being within a percent of his contemporaries. Checking whether this holds true in his team’s wins and losses, the trend doesn’t change significantly.
        <br>
        <br>
        Looking at his earned gold share and his damage share, we’re seeing a player who is given just as many resources as his contemporaries, but is putting up below average numbers. <b>On its face this would indicate that Solo is a below average contributor. That being said, damage isn’t everything, and it’s possible that looking at Solo’s champion pool, we’ll find that he’s more often than not placed in a more supportive role.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        This line of reasoning led me to pull some data I had not originally considered: kill participation (KP). The KP is showing how many of Solo’s team’s kills he’s contributing too. Remember, kills (and assists) can be considered a measure of forward progress against the opposing team. So the KP is a measure of how much forward progress Solo is contributing.

        <br>
    <p>
        Solo’s KP probably wins an award for most improved. He was pretty below average at the start of his career, but has improved almost 5% against the mean. While this doesn’t tell us if this is the result of him styling on his opponents, or whether he’s initiating plays, when combined with the Earned Gold Share (average) and the damage percentages (below average), it leads me to believe that Solo is often contributing to his teams fights in ways that aren’t just him pumping out damage. He’s likely locking down priority targets, protecting allies, and absorbing damage for his team.
        <br>
        <br>
        The last thing I want to touch on is Laning stats like CS/XP/Gold difference at 10 and 15 minutes. These are all statistics used to judge a players performance in lane. If a player is consistently up on minions, it means they are effectively “winning” their lane. Not much more nuance than that. I’m just trying to use this to get a sense of where Solo usually stacks up in lane
        <br>
        <br>
        I think it makes sense to first contextualize the available and expected numbers in this instance.

            The expectation is that a top laner would have somewhere around 80-100 minions at 10 minutes depending on whether the two players are just farming minions, or if they’re fighting a lot. There are a lot of nuances like freezing and crashing but for the most part by 10 minutes 80 minions is a good score.
            <br><br>
            What all this means is that CS differential of 1 or 2 is probably not a big deal. A CS differential of 6 or 7 though is a full wave and a decent chunk of experience. A CS differential of 10 or more at 10 minutes is huge and likely represents some sort of big play that put one player behind. A CS differential of 20 would be an unmitigated disaster.
            <br><br>
This chart shows Solo’s top laning at 10 stats isolated from the laning stats of his contemporaries. We can pretty simply see that from 2018-2020, Solo has improved against the rest of the LCS. In 2018, Solo was almost always behind at 10 minutes in every metric. Compare that to his 2020 stats, we can see that he brought himself into the top half of the league’s top laners.

        <div id="LaningAt10" style="width: 100%"></div>
        <br><br>
        At 15 Solo’s stats haven’t aged nearly as well. While not the bottom of the barrel, he’s definitely falling behind as the game transitions. I don’t think this is his fault though.
        <br><br>
        <div id="LaningAt15" style="width: 100%"></div>
        <br><br>
<p>
        One thing to point out on Top Laner’s laning statistics is that they can be somewhat influenced by the jungler. If your jungler tends to gank mid or bottom lane, or prioritizes dragons early, then the top laner is often left to play “weak side”. He can’t freely move forward and collect his minions for fear that the enemy jungler is lurking, and his jungler is too far away to respond. In 2020, Solo’s jungler has been Santorin, who is notable for being the “first blood king” meaning that he has the highest first blood participation percentage (55%) of any other jungler in the LCS. Solo, on the other hand is 6th in first blood participation (24%). This lends credence to the idea that his team probably uses him as a weak-side player, and so there will be times he has to sacrifice lane resources in order to protect himself.
	<br><br>
As teams begin to move around the map to make plays and take objectives, they try and get priority. This means they try and kill all of the opponents minions, and get their minion wave pushing towards their opponents side of the map. This maximizes the amount of gold/xp they get, while forcing the opposition to choose between collecting the minions pushing towards them, or leaving the rest of their team to fight for an objective undermanned. In a perfect world, your team always gets priority before an objective, but this is rarely the case. Since I suspect from Solo’s other numbers, that he’s often playing tanks or supportive roles, his teams absolutely need him to come to these plays, regardless of his lane priority. I would imagine Solo’s laning numbers are often sacrificed in order to try and get an advantage elsewhere on the map. 
        <br><br>
        I put together a table to recap where Solo stands amongst the LCS top laners. While he may dip above or below the average, in most cases he is well within a single standard deviation of the mean, meaning that the difference is fairly small. His Damage share is really the only stat with any significant difference, with his 2019 share being almost 2 Std above average and his 2020 share being below. This is probably due to how poor his team was in 2019, and how strong the carries are on his team in 2020. While his laning stats tend to fall on the negative side of the average, particularly at the 15 minute mark. I think this is likely a result of the champions he plays and how his team chooses to move him around the map.</p>

        <br><br>
        <p>
            A good chunk of these statistics I think are influenced by the champion choices made for and by Solo. Anecdotally, I think of Solo as player champions like Shen, Ornn, Aatrox, and Gangplank. The first two are firmly in the tank category, and the latter two are certainly capable of dealing damage, but I would imagine don’t work as hard carry champions like an Irelia, Camille, or Jax. I think we’re going to find that Solo has a champion pool spanning 3-4 champions per year, and that he generally plays champions that do below average damage.
            <br><br>
            The way I want to examine this is as follows: What champions does Solo play, how much damage do those champions tend to do, and where does Solo fall. I will categorize champions in 3 classes, Carry (high damage), Bruiser (medium damage) and Tank (low damage).
